Welcome to our app!
We begin at the login page, where the user enters their username and password to access the platform.
After logging in, we arrive at the home page. The screen is divided into two sections:
On the left side, we are simulating the user's location.
On the right side, we can see real-time updates reflecting these changes in the app.
As we hover over the marked icons on the map, details about the respective malls are displayed.
Next, let's explore the search functionality. In the search bar, we can type the name of any mall, and the app will instantly provide relevant results.
Now, if we simulate the user’s location to be near a mall, the app automatically displays nearby malls. For each mall, it shows:
The distance from the user’s current location.
A random offer featured at the top.
Users can also expand specific categories to view detailed store offers within that category.
At the bottom of the screen, there's an additional search functionality that allows users to look up other malls and compare offers with nearby malls.
Finally, based on user interactions within the app, we can utilize Generative AI to provide personalized offers. Currently, this feature is limited to tracking the number of clicks within the app.
